 *
 *
 *  \section Sec_ModDescription Module Description
 *  CDC Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of
 *  the USB CDC-ACM class Virtual Serial Ports, for both Device and Host USB
 *  modes. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing
 *  the CDC class manually via the low-level APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the
 *  required interface needed to interface with Hosts or Devices using the USB
 *  CDC Class.
