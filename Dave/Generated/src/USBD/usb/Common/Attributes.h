 *  \brief Special function/variable attribute macros.
 *
 *  This module contains macros for applying specific attributes to functions
 *  and variables to control various optimizer and code generation features of
 *  the compiler. Attributes may be placed in the function prototype or variable
 *   declaration in any order, and multiple attributes can be specified for a
 *   single item via a space separated list.
 *
 *  On incompatible versions of GCC or on other compilers, these macros evaluate
 *   to nothing unless they are critical to the code's function and thus must
 *   throw a compile error when used.
